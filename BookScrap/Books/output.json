{"Books_name": ["JBoss Tools 3 Developers Guide"], "Books_year": ["Anghel Leonard"], "Books_pages": [" 408"], "Books_lng": [" English"], "Books_desc": ["Since these technologies covered are different from each other, they are covered in separate chapters that are not interdependent; therefore you can learn to use whichever tool you want, without exploring the previous chapters. This approach sustains the learning per example paradigm and helps you to use the book as a quick guide for your favorite technologies. This book is recommended for Java developers who use at least one of the covered technologies (JSF, Struts, Hibernate, Seam, and so on). It is for all Java developers who are looking for a powerful, unitary tool, especially designed to increase the speed of development and quality of Java web applications. No matter how much (or how little) experience they have, developers of all levels will benefit as their use of JBoss Tools is directly proportional to the complexity of their application. Since JBoss Tools covers all levels of experience, you can use it at your own level for your own applications, without involving unnecessary features. All you need is to be familiar with the Eclipse environment and Java core, and to have some expertise in the technology for which you want to use the JBoss Tools. Basic expertise for each technology is provided in the book, but for more complete and detailed aspects you should read dedicated specifications, tutorials, and articles."]},
